## Features

- PDF Upload & Source Selection
- PDF Viewer
- Quiz Engine
- Progress Tracking Dashboard
- AI-Powered Chat

Please note that I could not add the YouTube Video Recommender and the Citations. While the groundwork for getting page numbers is there, I couldn't get the final implementation done. I have my midterms going on currently and managing both in 3 days was not enough :(


## LLM Tools

This project uses Large Language Models pretty heavily for its main features:

- Quiz Generation
- Chat (RAG)
- Topic Extraction (for the Progress Dashboard)
- Chat Title Generation
## Conclusion

Overall, I had a lot of fun working on this project! It was a great learning experience, especially when it came to building a full RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline from scratch and managing the state of a multi-panel, interactive application. A lot of the things were new to me and I'm glad to have been a part of this process. Hope you guys like it :D
